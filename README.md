# Python-Developer-Bootcamp
This repository contains my projects, challenges, and notes from the 100 Days of Code: Python Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. This comprehensive course covers Python fundamentals, web development, data science, automation, APIs, and more, with daily hands-on coding exercises and real-world projects to build practical programming skills.

Day 1: Working with Strings
Topics Covered:
Basics of strings in Python
String concatenation using the + operator
Using the len() function to calculate string length
Working with user input

Project:
Band Name Generator

Created a simple program to generate a band name by combining user inputs, such as the name of a city and a pet. This project demonstrates string manipulation and user interaction.

Day 2: Primitive Data Types and Number Manipulation
Topics Covered:

Primitive Data Types: int, float, bool, and string
Type Casting: Converting between data types (e.g., int() to float())
Mathematical Operations:
Using the BODMAS rule for complex calculations
Operators: +, -, *, /, ** (exponentiation), // (floor division), % (modulus)
Assignment Operators: Shortcuts like +=, -=, *=, /=
Number Manipulation: Techniques for rounding, formatting, and calculating values
F-strings: Simplified string formatting for embedding variables directly
Projects:
